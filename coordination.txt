At the start, I asked if everyone was okay with the group divison. It was, so we all kept the roles we were assigned to. Then I asked everyone what they wanted to use for an advertised product. Ianna and Sarah wanted to use a Stanley for the advertised product. I had the idea to do a "rent a monkey". However, we decided to use the Stanleys for the product. We chose the Stanley since it was 2 against one, majority won. We made our decisions, by choosing the option with the most votes. Then everyone got to work. We all started writing the three paragraphs. Sarah wrote her paragraph about the introduction of the Stanley Quencher. I am writing about why you should buy the Stanley especially the Quencher. Ianna is writing a paragraph about why you should buy the new collection of Stanley called the Valentines Day collection. After Ianna finished writing her paragrpah she also added a picture.
