At the start, I asked if everyone was okay with the Groupdivison. It was, so we all kept the roles we were assigned to. Ianna and Sarah wanted to use a Stanley for the advertised product. I had the idea to do a "rent a monkey". We decided to use the Stanleys for the product. We chose the Stanley since it was 2 against one, majority won.
